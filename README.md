## User Stories 
### As a user, I want...

- [X] a way to see each available collection of flash cards with its title, so that I can easily distinguish the collection of flash cards.
- [X] to select a collection to put in use, with the “active” collection being visibly different than the other collections.
- [X] to create a flash card in a collection and save to the JSON dataset, so that I have a way to see the word and definition.
- [X] a way to go to the next card in the collection or a previous card in the collection.
- [X] to see a count of how many total cards are in a collection as well as what number card is currently active in the collection.
- [X] there to be an animated transition from word to definition and vice versa when I click on a flash card. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
